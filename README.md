# OldTale.nvim

A Neovim colorscheme that preserves your eyes while coding. OldTale is a theme derived from [oldworld.nvim](https://github.com/dgox16/oldworld.nvim), which itself was inspired by [mellow.nvim](https://github.com/mellow-theme/mellow.nvim). While maintaining the spirit of comfortable viewing, OldTale introduces subtle adjustments to the color palette and additional plugin integrations.
Why create a new theme? While deeply appreciating oldworld.nvim's approach to eye comfort, I wanted to make slight adjustments to better suit my personal preferences, particularly in syntax highlighting and UI elements.

## üì¶ Installation

With [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
    "yourusername/oldtale.nvim",
    lazy = false,
    priority = 1000,
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

Using lua:

```lua
luaCopyvim.cmd.colorscheme("oldtale")
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The theme comes with sensible defaults, but you can customize it to your liking:

```lua
local default_config = {
	terminal_colors = true,
	styles = {
		comments = {},
		keywords = {},
		identifiers = {},
		functions = {},
		variables = {},
		booleans = {},
	},
	integrations = {
		blink = false,
		cmp = false,
		gitsigns = false,
		indent_blankline = false,
		lazy = false,
		lsp = false,
		markdown = false,
		mason = false,
		noice = false,
		notify = false,
		rainbow_delimiters = false,
		telescope = false,
		treesitter = false,
	},
	highlight_overrides = {},
}

```

To customize the theme, pass your configuration like this:

```lua
require("oldtale").setup({
	styles = {
		booleans = { italic = true, bold = true },
	},
	integrations = {
		blink = true,
		telescope = true,
	},
	highlight_overrides = {
		Comment = { bg = "#ff0000" },
	},
})
```
